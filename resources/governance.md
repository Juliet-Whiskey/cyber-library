## Standards & Frameworks
### _ISO 27001_
  - ISO 27001 is probably one of the best known enterprise security standards, helping organisations “establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and continually improve an ISMS”. It is a best-practice framework to help organisations manage their information security holistically, by addressing people and processes as well as technology. Accreditation to the Standard is recognised globally, and a solid indication that an organisations security ISMS is aligned with information security best practice. The latest version of the ISO 27001 standard was published in September 2013, replacing the 2005 iteration.
